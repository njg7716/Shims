1. What is the goal of this tool? What purpose does it bring to the competitions?
	- The goal of this tool is to maintain persistence on a linux machine. If the blue team finds my connection and terminates it, the next time they run the ls command I will get another shell. This will help ensure that I will always have control of the box.
2. Did other tools influence your tool? If so, what are they? If not, what was your inspiration for the tool?
	- My decision was a little influenced based on what tools my team was doing because there was not a tool like this one being made yet. I had heard of shims before and I had never made one so I felt like this was the perfect time to learn how to make one.
3. What is the feasibility of another team member quickly learning to use or contribute to your tool? What makes it easy or difficult to learn?
	- This is super easy to learn. There is not a lot of code and I have made a script to automatically deploy the shim. All they have to do is run the script and sit and wait for a user to run the ls command.
